# Process and result

We could choose any topic for what to base the content of the website on. I chose to create a homepage for a music artist named WOODZ where the blogs posts content would be represented as the discography.

The design process was fun, and I spent some time in Photoshop trying to figure out how to add details such as paint splashes as decor.

At this point I still don't feel too confident about my skills in using JS to creating smooth-working and smart functionality. The homepage is supposed to have a carousel of images that links to the different posts you can view. The end product doesn't work as well as I had hoped and I believe the issue lies with my use of async and how to fetch the posts before showcasing them in this specific format.

The code is also quite messy and I want to improve my code by making it more practical and readable.
